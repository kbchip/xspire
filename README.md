# Xspire
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.0--alpha-blue?logo=semver)](https://github.com/kbchip/xspire/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha)

Xspire is a food tracking application for people who want to get the most out of their ingredients. Users can keep tabs on when food was bought, where it is stored, and when it expires. Xspire also provides recipe suggestions for food that's about to go bad, as well as recipes that only include ingredients the user has on hand.

## Getting Started

As Xspire uses Next.js, building it is as simple as [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), cloning the `main` branch (we recommend a [shallow clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/shallow) unless you _really_ need all the commit history of every branch) and running this command:
```
npm install
```
Start a local web server with 
```
npm start
```
then open up a browser, type in `localhost:3000` in the address bar, and you're good to go!

## Built With

- Next.js: Web framework used
