# Xspire
[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.0--alpha-blue?logo=semver)](https://github.com/kbchip/xspire/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha)

Xspire is a food tracking application for people who want to get the most out of their ingredients. Users can keep tabs on when food was bought, where it is stored, and when it expires. Xspire also provides recipe suggestions for food that's about to go bad, as well as recipes that only include ingredients the user has on hand.

## Getting Started

As Xspire uses Next.js, building it is as simple as [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), cloning the `main` branch (we recommend a [shallow clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/shallow) unless you _really_ need all the commit history of every branch), and then running the following to start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
